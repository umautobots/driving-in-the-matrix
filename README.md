# Driving in the Matrix

Steps to reproduce training results for the paper 
[Driving in the Matrix: Can Virtual Worlds Replace Human-Generated Annotations for Real World Tasks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01983)
conducted at [UM & Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles (FCAV)](https://fcav.engin.umich.edu).

Specifically, we will train [MXNet RCNN](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/tree/master/example/rcnn) on our 
[10k dataset](https://fcav.engin.umich.edu/sim-dataset) 
and evaluate on [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php).

*Coming soon!*
